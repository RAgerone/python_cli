# Food Truck CLI

## About

## Setup
__In the main directory in your terminal run this command__

```bash
pipenv install
```
This will set up your pip environment.

_Note:  If you don't already have Pipenv and you have a Mac, you can install it with 'brew install pipenv'.  \
If you don't feel like doing that, I have added a requirements.txt in the same directory.  You can use that to set up \
your virtual environment.  I believe you can run all of the same commands in your virtual environment using pip instead of pipenv._

__Activate your virtual environment__

```bash
pipenv shell
```

## Build

```bash
pipenv install --editable .
```

## Run
In your terminal with your shell (virtual environment) activated:
```bash
food_truck
```
